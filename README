2. Compilation of librairies and sample programs
----------------------------------------------------

In order to compile sample programs, verify that you have following package installed on your sytem
- libusb            : Main library for Usb bus access in user mode
- libusb-devel      : Include file to compile and link with libusb
- libSDL            : library for displaying image in sample programs
- libSDL-devel      : Include file for libSDL
- libSDL_ttf        : library for writing text string into SDL window
- libSDL_ttf-devel  : Include file for libSDL_ttf

Once all these libraries are installed, just type:
    make

This command compiles Sagem librairies in lib/ and sample programs in samples/bin directory

Another sample is provided in order to show how to link with installed library:
samples/Sample_aferInstall
After installation, type make in this directory. 
This will compile sample program and link with /usr/local/lib/libMSO/libMSO and 
/usr/local/lib/libMSO/libMSOComm. Change prefix in Makefile if needed.


3. Intallation procedure
-----------------------------

Edit Makefile and modify if needed the following fields:
PREFIX = /usr/local	(Default)
	Installation prefix: 'lib' will be installed in /usr/local/lib/libMSO
			     'include' will be installed in /usr/local/include/libMSO

HOTPLUG=none or HOTPLUG_MODE = hotplug or HOTPLUG_MODE = udev
	installation mode for hot pluggable device detection:
		none: Installs nothing	(Default)
		udev: For recent kernel (>= 2.6.12). Check that you have udev installed 
	              and /etc/udev directory
		hotplug: For older kernel (2.4.X and 2.6.X). Check that you have hotplug installed and 
	 	         /etc/hotplug directory

If you choose HOTPLUG=none, you will have access to your device only in root.
If you install hotplug or udev script, kernel will automatically change rights on 
device (/proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD) when a MorphoSmart is plugged on USB bus. You will have 
access to the device in user mode.
You can get bus number and device number with lsusb command (package usbutils needed) and check that you have
the correct rights on the device file /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD.

Udev lets you specify the node name and access rights for your device. An example is provided
in hotplug_conf/Example directory (tested with Fedora core 5)


For serial connection, you need to have read/write right access on serial device file (ex: /dev/ttyS0)
You can change the rights, in 'root', with 
    chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0

Type :
    make 
This command compiles libraries and sample executables

and type as root:
    make install. 

This command installs libraries, include files and hotplug or udev files if specified with HOTPLUG field. 
Lib path to Sagem library is added to /etc/ld.so.config, and /sbin/ldconfig is executed.


4. Troubleshooting
------------------------

On some systems, acm module (kernel 2.4.X) or cdc_acm module (kernel 2.6.X) is loaded when a sagem device 
is inserted. It can be necessary to unload this module with: 
    rmmod acm 
or:
    rmmod cdc_acm 

To ensure this module doesn't interfere with the libraries, you can add the following command
in modules.conf (kernel 2.4.X) or in modprobe.conf (kernel 2.6.X):

    alias acm off
or
    alias cdc_acm off

This will force acm module to stay unloaded.
